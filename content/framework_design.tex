enhance the existing unit testing capabilities by integrating advanced data preparation and handling mechanisms.
Unit testing is a critical practice in modern software development,
ensuring that individual components of an application behave as expected.
However, setting up and managing test data can often become a cumbersome process,
especially in complex systems where tests depend on intricate data structures,

\section{Framework Architecture}

The architecture of the framework is carefully designed to ensure scalability,
maintainability, and seamless integration with existing unit testing workflows.

The framework architecture is divided into two main components. The first component focuses on data preparation, while the second encompasses the test case, which includes the tests themselves. Except for specific framework elements, the test case retains the same components as those used in NUnit testing. The framework extends the functionality of the test case by defining whether it should be executed, specifying the framework services required for the test case, and identifying the prepared data to be used for individual tests.

Data preparation represents an additional feature compared to standard testing and requires developers to become familiar with its implementation when using the framework. The design of the data preparation component is structured to support both class-level and method-level test data preparation. The primary task for developers is to create a class associated, for example, with a specific tested method. The class does not require a constructor unless the developer requires dependencies on specific services. Instead, it only needs to define methods for setting up the data and for cleaning up the prepared data after testing.

This architectural approach ensures that the framework provides added value through structured data preparation while maintaining compatibility with known NUnit-based test case practices. The framework's design is intended to be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal effort to adapt to the new data preparation features. The architecture is designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionalities as needed. The framework's modular design ensures that each component can be easily replaced or extended without affecting the overall functionality of the system.

It is structured into distinct layers,
each fulfilling specific responsibilities while adhering to principles of modular design and separation of concerns. The following subsections describe the primary components of the architecture.

\subsection{Attributes Layer}

The \textit{Attributes Layer} is designed to facilitate the management of test data and the configuration of test frameworks. Almost every attribute in this layer serves as a directive indicating that a particular test case or method requires the preparation and use of specific data. The attributes provide a structured way to manage data setup and cleansing and ensure that the necessary  data conditions are met before and after test execution. The main reason to use attributes is to allow the programmer to extend the functionality of the NUnit framework and to ensure that there is no significant change in the process of how the tests are created and that the programmer does not need to spend too much effort to extend the knowledge of how the tests are created. The result is that testing will be almost the same as before the extension of the framework and that there will be no need to learn new procedures or approaches to testing.


\subsection*{Attributes for Data Preparation}

The \textit{Attributes for Data Preparation} layer is designed to manage the setup and cleanup of test data within testing. The attributes serve as directives that indicate specific data requirements for test cases or methods. Provide a structured way to prepare, call, and remove prepared test data.  Ensure that the test environment is properly configured and that the conditions for test data are met before, during, and after test execution. This layer provides a unified approach to data setup manipulation that enables precise control over data preparation management, which is essential to maintain robustness and maintainability of test procedures.

The attributes for data preparation for a class or method are different, but the data preparation structure is the same. This structure ensures a uniform approach to data preparation management, which is key to maintaining the robustness and maintainability of test practices. Instead of forcing programmers to implement the data preparation structure for each test method separately, it allows them to simply use the prepared data techniques and ensure that they are used correctly.
Although the data preparation structure is the same for class-prepared and method-prepared data, there are differences in how these attributes are used and how they affect test scenarios.Attributes for preparing data for a class allow you to define methods for preparing data that are necessary for testing the whole class. The attributes ensure that the data preparation methods are properly configured and initialized according to the test scenario. The data preparation method attributes, allow more precise control over the preparation of data specific to a particular test scenario. 
All attributes support parameterized data inputs, allowing resolution for tests that have similar preparation requirements but different input parameters. The addition of parameters ensures that the data preparation is appropriate to the specific test requirements and that the data preparation can be dynamically changed according to the needs of the test.

The data preparation structure is created by the programmer independently. Consists of identification for which class or method the programmer wants to prepare the data to what the given attribute will help and enables the programmer to arrange the given structure to the class or method.

\subsection*{Testing Attributes}

Test attributes help define the test scenarios in which test data needs to be prepared and used. Each of the attributes provides unique properties that allow for different data processing configurations. The base test attribute determines if the framework is to be used at all for a given test case. Other attributes are dedicated to calling data preparation for different tests as well as subsequent data rollback. By defining the attributes for a test, it is possible to specify more precisely how the data should be prepared and used. In this way it is possible to adapt the data processing to the needs of the test and ensure that the data is prepared correctly.
Ensure that the necessary services are configured and initialized according to the unique requirements of each test scenario.

The attributes are divided into two main types. The first is an attribute that identifies that a specific test data is to be used for a given test method or class. Recognizable by the \textit{For} expression. The second type of attribute allows to call the prepared data directly without knowing which method or class is used in the test. The design allows the programmer to easily access the prepared data during test execution. Enables precise selection of data sources needed for a given test.

In the above cases, we are still discussing calls to prepared data that have no parameters or don't need them. An extended version of these attributes are attributes that allow the use of parameters to define the preparation and manipulation of test data. The attributes allow more precise control over how the data is manipulated based on the specified parameters.  Such a structure ensures a systematic approach to test data management. The attributes containing the \textit{Params} expression in the name.

\subsection*{Attributes of prepared data}

Interfaces provide a guaranteed direction and enforce adherence to a specified structure; however, they can limit a programmer’s flexibility. To ensure that developers retain sufficient freedom while allowing prepared data to conform to the structure they envision, attributes were introduced. The attributes, designed to facilitate data preparation for tested methods or functions, indicate whether the operation involves the deployment of prepared data or its removal.

The attributes are defined before the method responsible for handling the data. Their primary benefit lies in granting developers the ability to incorporate input parameters, enabling precise customization of data preparation and manipulation processes.
The approach ensures data preparation and processing processes remain consistent with testing requirements, while allowing developers to tailor them to the specific needs of individual test scenarios.


\subsection{Interface Layer}
The \textit{Interface Layer} consists of the interfaces that cover the preparation and management of test data and related services. The Layer ensures consistency and modularity in the way data is prepared for test scenarios, supporting a structured approach.

Interfaces for preparing data for testing are designed for the class and method levels. These interfaces provide non-parametric methods for data staging and subsequent data cleansing, i.e the method to be run before and after the test.

In addition to data preparation, the interfaces layer contains mechanisms for managing test services. The interfaces extend the test case and add additional functionality to the framework.   One of them is used to register and initialize services in the container within the test framework. 
The interface provides a structured resource that the classes for preparing the data accept and can use according to the developer's thinking.
Another interface is for defining the databases to be used in the test case. 

TODO


\subsection{Data Handling Layer}


The \textit{Data Handling Layer} is responsible for orchestrating the preparation, management, and cleanup of test data. The layer introduces key components to ensure the integrity and consistency of the testing environment.

The core of the \textit{Data Handling Layer} is a system that automates the execution of methods for deploying prepared data and cleaning. The handler enforces a deterministic order of execution, ensuring that all preparatory logic is executed before the test is run and that cleanup operations are then reliably performed. In addition, the layer contains exception handling mechanisms that guarantee proper cleanup even in situations where tests fail unexpectedly.

The \texttt{Preparation data store} complements the handler by providing a centralized repository for managing data preparation instances associated with test methods. The store optimizes test execution through caching of prepared data, reducing redundant computations and improving performance. Additionally, the store is implemented with thread safety to support concurrent test executions in multi-threaded environments.

\subsection{Integration Layer}
\textit{Integration Layer} aims to increase the efficiency of attribute execution and promote modularity through service-oriented design.
The \texttt{Attribute Count Storage} is critical in ensuring proper execution of data preparation. The \texttt{Attribute Count Storage} monitors the invocation of attributes applied to test methods, preventing duplicate execution of methods for preparing and cleaning test data when multiple attributes are stored on top of each other. This mechanism ensures that all preparatory logic runs as expected while maintaining efficiency.

To further isolate the preparatory logic, is used the \texttt{Provider Store} framework, which acts as a service provider. This component supports dependency injection principles, allowing developers to dynamically register and load services in the test. This approach allows the framework to seamlessly integrate with existing dependency injection frameworks, such as \texttt{Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection}.


\section{NUnit Integration}
The framework achieves seamless integration with NUnit by extending its lifecycle through the use of custom hooks. We facilitate this integration by implementing the \texttt{ITestAction} interface, which provides NUnit attributes with methods that enable the execution of logic both prior to and following the execution of a test.

Methods within the \texttt{ITestAction} interface, such as \texttt{BeforeTest} and \texttt{AfterTest}, are overridden to introduce steps for preparing data before test execution, as well as performing post-test cleanup and managing other services invoked and instantiated by the framework. This approach ensures that the data preparation and teardown processes are smoothly incorporated into the test execution flow without disrupting the inherent structure of NUnit's testing lifecycle.

For enhanced control over test behavior, the test targets are specified within the attributes, ensuring that the custom logic is applied to individual test methods. Moreover, the architecture is designed to support extensibility, enabling the targeting of entire test classes or namespaces, thereby allowing developers to apply bulk-processing logic as needed.

\subsection{Parallel Execution Support}
TODO
Given the growing importance of parallelism in modern testing frameworks, the architecture has been designed to ensure reliable behavior in NUnit's \textit{parallel execution mode}. All lifecycle hooks, data preparation stores, and service providers are implemented with thread safety guarantees. This ensures that test data preparation and cleanup operations are executed consistently, even when tests are run concurrently across multiple threads.
