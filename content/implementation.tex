data preparation
Attribute whcih class use are in two types.
 - method and class
 - in body are same
 -for class has arguement type and LIfeTime for service colection - defualt Transient
 -for method type and string which is name of method, and Lifetime for serivice - defu Transient

in class for prepared data are attributes
    DownData and UpData for method
    define action for data prepared class
    


test principle attribute
-main class attribute ITestAction Interface
    -define using of framework
    -analyze all attribute using reflection
     - find all attributes for data preparation in test, and setup counters
     -  find all prepared data and make reference  dictionary test method/ class with data preparation
    class if not found
    -and create base injection with preparad data classes  
    -create own service provider with data preparation if user define interface for test case
    - add this provider to case Provider store
   

-exists 4 attributes for calling prepared data
    -before test
        -set up provider for test case
        -find prepared data defined in attribute or register for tested method and create instance of data prepared class from case provider
        - add this instance of prepared data class to test
        - count up counter
        -repeat all for counter is equal 
        - on the last attribute invoke data for  all prepared data class instance

    - run test
    
    -after test 
        -count down
        -repaet after equal
        -call for each test registerd data preparation class tear down method

-specification for attributes:
